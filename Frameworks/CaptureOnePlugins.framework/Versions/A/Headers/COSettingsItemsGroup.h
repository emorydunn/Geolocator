 `COSettingsItemsGroup` represents a group of settings.

 @note Groups can't be nested deeper than one level. A group can be inside a group, but the nested group cannot
 contain additional groups.

 @note The rendering of `COSettingsItemsGroup` items in Capture One depends on the placement of the group item in a hierarchy
 of settings. If it is on the first level, it will be rendered as a tab in the plugin's settings panel. If it is nested
 in another group, it is displayed as a section with a headline within a tab.
