 Returns the description of the settings UI displayed in the plugin manager.
 
 Each `COSettingsElementsGroup` object returned is displayed as a tab, unless there is
 only one group, in which case, the tab-bar will not be rendered at all.

 In real world implementations, the decisin to create one or more tabs would be taken
 in accordance to the functionality that the plugin provides.

 For instance, a plugin that offers both publishing and round-trip editting
 functionality, or publishing functionality, but to multiple platforms, may want
 to visually separate the settings pertinent to each type of action - or to
 each publishing platform - so as to offer the user a clear context for the
 settings they are customizing.

 Respond to a change in the value of a setting as a result of user interaction.
 
 Capture One calls this method for every updated setting in Capture One's plugin
 manager. Implementations can use this method to persist the setting value and optionally,
 validate and notify Capture One if appropriate.
 
 @warning Since Capture One does not handle the persistency aspect, implementations
 should provide this functionality as appropriate. However, because of the user
 experience considerations involved in choosing latency prone storage options -
 such as calls to remote service APIs - developers are strongly encouraged to use
 either `NSUserDefaults` or another low latency approach.
